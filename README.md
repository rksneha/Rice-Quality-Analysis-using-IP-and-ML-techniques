# Rice-Quality-Analysis-using-IP-and-ML-techniques

## ABOUT
 This project is an attempt to understand the quality of rice through image processing techniques and neural networks. This project aims to reduce tedious and time-consuming manual activity when it comes to quality analysis. A model has been implemented for quality analysis using image-processing techniques, Canny edge-detection, Feature-extraction. These features are then presented to the neural network for training the model. The trained network will then be used to identify the rice quality into grades of A,B,C.
